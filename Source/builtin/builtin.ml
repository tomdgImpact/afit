(** Tweaking OCaml built-in euclidean division

The OCaml built-in euclidian divisions operations do not follow the
standard mathematical conventions. We adapt OCaml available
primitives to suit maths conventions.

(** Division of an integer by a natural number. NOT OCAML DEFAULT.
    Division of an integer by a non-zero integer b is the unique couple
